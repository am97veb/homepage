## ‚öô Technologies

 The application is written in VanillaJS. I used symantic HTML tags, CSS to style elements with classes that follow the BEM convention.  JS used to handle theme changes by using elements with the querySelector method, classList.toggle to assign classes with a modifier and using a forEach loop to iterate over several captured elements.

Used tools and convencion:
- Semantic & accessible HTML
- CSS BEM convention
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Custom properties
- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript
- Git
